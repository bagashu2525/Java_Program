Exception:
The java.lang.Throwable class is the root class of java exception hierarchy which is inherited by two 
subclasses:
1) Exception
2) Error 

Types of Exception:
1) Checked Exception - The classes which directly inherit Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error 
are known as checked exceptions. They are checked at compile time. 
2) Unchecked Exception - The classes which inherit the RuntimeException class are known as unchecked Exception.
3) Error - it is irrecoverable e.g OutOfMemoryError, AssertionError etc.

Java Exception Keywords: 
Java provides five keywords that are used to handle the exception. The following table describes each.

Keyword	Description
try - The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place an exception code. It means we can't use try block alone. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally.
catch - The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone. It can be followed by finally block later.
finally - The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.
throw - The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.
throws - The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method. It doesn't throw an exception. It is always used with method signature.
